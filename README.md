# Symfony project - Reef

This project was made during HORELLOU Th√©o's Symfony lessons.

It's a Twitter-like application. You can register and login to it. When you're connected, you can see the messages posted by all the users, add a new message or delete a message you posted.

## Launch project

To start the project, launch a CMD, go on the project's directory and run
```bash
symfony server:start
```

Then launch your navigator, type the URL of the site (Example: "localhost:8000") and add "/login" at the end to access the login page of the app (Example: "localhost:8000/login").
